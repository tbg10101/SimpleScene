### Double Precision SimpleScene BVH for Unity 3D

This is a fork of the [SimpleScene](https://github.com/jeske/SimpleScene) repo which extracts and cleans up the BVH system, makes it usable in Unity, and increases number precision to 64-bit.

I (Tristan Bellman-Greenwood) am making these changes mainly for use in Fragmented Galaxy because it is built using Unity and the worlds are very large. (solar-system sized)
